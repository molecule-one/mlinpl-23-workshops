Code support workshops run at the MLinPL 2023 conference. The workshops are centered around submitting
compounds to a leaderboard using various strategies.

## Features

1. Leaderboad with server for scoring compounds for three proteins (DRD2, GSK3b, JNK)

2. Three strategies to generate compounds: random exploration, mutation based, machine learning based

## Components

1. [notebooks/MLinPL_23_Workshops.ipynb](Exercise notebook): exercises for workshop.

2. [server/README.md](Server README.md): information on using the server behind

3. [solutions](Solution implementation): implementation of solutions
